Welcome to **VARCem**, the Virtual Archaeological Computer EMulator.

VARCem is a software application which emulates a selection of of (mostly)
x86-based PC systems and devices based on the ISA, EISA, VLB, MCA and PCI
system buses.

The program tries to be cycle-exact, meaning the guest software (the software
being run inside the emulated system) will run as fast (or, depending on how
you see that..) as slow as it did "back then".  If you selected, say, a 80286
running at 12MHz, that is what the software will see, and how fast it will be
run.


HISTORY
-------
VARCem started out as a new branch of the 86Box emulator, after discussions 
on which path to follow forward. 86Box in its own is a fork of the popular
PCem emulator. At each generation, code and ideas were taken from other
emulator projects, such as DOSBox, Vbox, MAME, Qemu and so on.

a business-critical piece of (old) software at work, for example.

If there is a problem with the software, please open up a GIT issue so we
can work on it, and/or talk to us on the IRC channel. We cannot promise a
fix, but will try the best we can !
